<h1>Landing Page FinMind 🌐</h1>
The FinMind Landing Page (a fictional brand I created) is completely modern and responsive. A clean, lightweight website that grabs the visitor's attention. This example is perfect for showing that you don't need a lot of JavaScript to create a good project. We can get a good result using only HTML and CSS (without frameworks).
